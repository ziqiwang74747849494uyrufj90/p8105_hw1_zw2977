## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library("moderndive")

library(ggplot2)

data("early_january_weather")
```

# Problem 1

```{r}
names(early_january_weather)

nrow(early_january_weather)

ncol(early_january_weather)

mean(early_january_weather$temp)

scatter.plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

ggsave("c:\\Ziqi Wang 1\\scatter plot.png", scatter.plot)
```

As the temperature increases, the humidity also increases.

# Problem2

```{r}
sample.numeric <- rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

sample.logic <- sample.numeric > 0

sample.char <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","k")

sample.factor <-c("small","medium","high","small","medium","high"
                ,"small","medium","high","small")

sample.factor <- factor(sample.factor)

data <- data.frame(sample.numeric, sample.logic, sample.char, sample.factor)

mean(data$sample.numeric)

mean(data$sample.logic)

mean(data$sample.char)

mean(data$sample.factor)
```
